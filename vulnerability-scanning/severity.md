 Discussion: Handling differences between NIST "Severity" and Ubuntu "Priority" #3395 

 https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/3395 

 First of all, we're sure the severities from vendors are more accurate. For example, Red Hat scores CVE-2022-3715 as 6.6, even though NVD scores 7.8. It depends on the compile option, the default configuration, etc. NVD doesn't know how the vendor distributes the software. Red Hat evaluates the severity more accurately. So, Trivy definitely should prefer Red Hat scores over NVD. The same can be said for Ubuntu.

The current discussion is "Priority" can be used for "Severity" or not.

    Ubuntu's Priority is intended to help prioritize fixing the bug - eg: how/when should maintainers schedule the bug to be fixed

It is different from NVD's severity, but as the document describes, the priority is based on many factors including severity, importance, risk, install base, software configuration, active exploitation and other factors. It is good to know how Ubuntu maintainers are thinking.
As we have said before, while this information is valuable, it could be helpful to treat it as a separate value from severity as it causes confusion.

The stdout shows the most appropriate severity only. But CycloneDX shows severities from all the data sources. You can see the same in the JSON format.
